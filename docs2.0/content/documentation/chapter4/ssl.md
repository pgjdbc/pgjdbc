Configuring the PostgreSQLâ„¢ server for SSL is covered in the [main
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html),
so it will not be repeated here. There are also instructions in the source
[certdir](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/tree/master/certdir)
Before trying to access your SSL enabled server from Java, make sure
you can get to it via **psql**. You should see output like the following
if you have established a SSL  connection.

```
$ ./bin/psql -h localhost -U postgres
psql (9.6.2)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```
