To use the driver, the JAR archive named `postgresql-MM.nn.pp.jar` needs to be included in the class path,
either by putting it in the `CLASSPATH` environment variable, or by using flags on
the **java** command line.

For instance, assume we have an application that uses the JDBC driver to access
a database, and that application is installed as `/usr/local/lib/myapp.jar`. The
PostgreSQL™ JDBC driver installed as `/usr/local/pgsql/share/java/postgresql-MM.nn.pp.jar`.
To run the application, we would use:

```bash
export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/lib/myapp.jar:/usr/local/pgsql/share/java/postgresql-42.2.15.jar:.
java MyApp
```

Current Java applications will likely use maven, gradle or some other package manager.

latest jars and how to include them in your project


Loading the driver from within the application is covered in [Chapter 3, Initializing the Driver](use.html).
