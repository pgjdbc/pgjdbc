### Removed
- Drop support for the (insecure) crypt authentication method. [PR 1026](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1026)

## [42.1.4] (2017-08-01)
### Changed
- Statements with non-zero fetchSize no longer require server-side named handle. This might cause issues when using old PostgreSQL versions (pre-8.4)+fetchSize+interleaved ResultSet processing combo. [Issue 869](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/869)

## [42.1.3] (2017-07-14)
### Fixed
- Fix NPE in PreparedStatement.executeBatch in case of empty batch (regression since 42.1.2). [PR 867](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/867)

## [42.1.2] (2017-07-12)
### Changed
- Better logic for *returning* keyword detection. Previously, pgjdbc could be defeated by column names that contain *returning*, so pgjdbc failed to "return generated keys" as it considered statement as already having *returning* keyword [PR 824](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/824) [201daf1d](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/201daf1dc916bbc35e2bbec961aebfd1b1e30bfc) 
- Use server-prepared statements for batch inserts when prepareThreshold>0. Note: this enables batch to use server-prepared from the first *executeBatch()* execution (previously it waited for *prepareThreshold* *executeBatch()* calls) [abc3d9d7](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/abc3d9d7f34a001322fbbe53f25d5e77a33a667f)

### Fixed
- Replication API: fix issue in #834 setting statusIntervalUpdate causes high CPU load. [PR 835](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/835) [59236b74](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/59236b74acdd400d9d91d3eb2bb07d70b15392e5)

### Regresions
- NPE in PreparedStatement.executeBatch in case of empty batch. Fixed in 42.1.3

## [42.1.1] (2017-05-05)
### Fixed
- Fix infinite dates that might be corrupted when transferred in binary for certain JREs. For instance, 5881610-07-11 instead of infinity. [1e5bf563](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/1e5bf563f41203417281117ed20b183cd295b4e0)

## [42.1.0] (2017-05-04)
### Added
- Support fetching a REF_CURSOR using getObject [PR 809](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/809)

### Fixed
- Fix data being truncated in setCharacterStream (bug introduced in 42.0.0) [PR 802](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/802)
- Fix calculation of lastReceiveLSN for logical replication [PR 801](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/801)
- Make sure org.postgresql.Driver is loaded when accessing though DataSource interface [Issue 768](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/768)

### Regressions
- There's no 42.1.0.jre6 version due to infinity handling bug. Fixed in 42.1.1.jre6

## [42.0.0] (2017-02-20)
### Added
- Replication protocol API was added: [replication API documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org//documentation/head/replication.html). [PR 550](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/550)
- java.util.logging is now used for logging: [logging documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org//documentation/head/logging.html). [PR 722](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/722)
- Add support for PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream(int, Reader). [ee4c4265](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/ee4c4265aebc1c73a1d1fabac5ba259d1fbfd1e4)

### Changed
- Version bumped to 42.0.0 to avoid version clash with PostgreSQL version and follow a better sematic versioning. [46634923](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/466349236622c6b03bb9cd8d7f517c3ce0586751)
- Ensure executeBatch() can be used with pgbouncer. Previously pgjdbc could use server-prepared statements for batch execution even with prepareThreshold=0. [Issue 742](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/742)
- Error position is displayed when SQL has unterminated literals, comments, etc. [Issue 688](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/688)
- Strict handling of accepted values in getBoolean and setObject(BOOLEAN), now it follows PostgreSQL accepted values, only 1 and 0 for numeric types are accepted (previously !=0 was true). [PR 732](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/732)
- Return correct versions and name of the driver. [PR 668](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/668)

### Removed
- Support for PostgreSQL versions below 8.2 was dropped. [PR 661](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/661)

### Deprecated
- Deprecated PGPoolingDataSource, instead of this class you should use a fully featured connection pool like HikariCP, vibur-dbcp, commons-dbcp, c3p0, etc. [PR 739](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/739)

### Regressions
- Data truncated in setCharacterStream. Fixed in 42.1.0
- No suitable driver found for jdbc:postgresql when using a DataSource implementation. Fixed in 42.1.0
