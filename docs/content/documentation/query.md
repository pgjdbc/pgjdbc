#  Issuing a Query and Processing the Result

Any time you want to issue SQL statements to the database, you require a `Statement`

or `PreparedStatement` instance. Once you have a `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` ,
you can use issue a query. This will return a `ResultSet` instance, which contains
the entire result (see the section called [“Getting results based on a cursor”](query.html#query-with-cursor)
here for how to alter this behaviour). [Example 5.1, “Processing a Simple Query in JDBC”](query.html#query-example)
illustrates this process.

**Example 5.1. Processing a Simple Query in JDBC**

This example will issue a simple query and print out the first column of each
row using a `Statement` .

```java
Statement st = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = 500");
while (rs.next())
{
    System.out.print("Column 1 returned ");
    System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
}
rs.close();
st.close();
```

This example issues the same query as before but uses a `PreparedStatement` and
a bind value in the query.

```java
int foovalue = 500;
PreparedStatement st = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = ?");
st.setInt(1, foovalue);
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();
while (rs.next())
{
    System.out.print("Column 1 returned ");
    System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
}
rs.close();
st.close();
```

## Getting results based on a cursor

By default the driver collects all the results for the query at once. This can
be inconvenient for large data sets so the JDBC driver provides a means of basing
a `ResultSet` on a database cursor and only fetching a small number of rows.

A small number of rows are cached on the client side of the connection and when
exhausted the next block of rows is retrieved by repositioning the cursor.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

Cursor based `ResultSets` cannot be used in all situations. There a number of
restrictions which will make the driver silently fall back to fetching the
whole `ResultSet` at once.

* The connection to the server must be using the V3 protocol. This is the default
	for (and is only supported by) server versions 7.4 and later.

* The `Connection` must not be in autocommit mode. The backend closes cursors at
	the end of transactions, so in autocommit mode the backend will have
	closed the cursor before anything can be fetched from it.

* The `Statement` must be created with a `ResultSet` type of `ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`.
	This is the default, so no code will need to be rewritten to take advantage
	of this, but it also means that you cannot scroll backwards or otherwise
	jump around in the `ResultSet` .

* The query given must be a single statement, not multiple statements strung
	together with semicolons.

{{< /admonition >}}

**Example 5.2. Setting fetch size to turn cursors on and off.**

Changing code to cursor mode is as simple as setting the fetch size of the
`Statement` to the appropriate size. Setting the fetch size back to 0 will cause
all rows to be cached (the default behaviour).

```java
// make sure autocommit is off
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = conn.createStatement();

// Turn use of the cursor on.
st.setFetchSize(50);
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable");
while (rs.next())
{
    System.out.print("a row was returned.");
}
rs.close();

// Turn the cursor off.
st.setFetchSize(0);
rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable");
while (rs.next())
{
    System.out.print("many rows were returned.");
}
rs.close();

// Close the statement.
st.close();
```

##  Using the Statement or PreparedStatement Interface

The following must be considered when using the `Statement` or `PreparedStatement`

interface:

* You can use a single `Statement` instance as many times as you want. You could
	create one as soon as you open the connection and use it for the connection's
	lifetime. But you have to remember that only one `ResultSet` can exist
	per `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` at a given time.

* If you need to perform a query while processing a `ResultSet`, you can simply
	create and use another `Statement` .

* If you are using threads, and several are using the database, you must use a
	separate `Statement` for each thread. Refer to [Chapter 10, *Using the Driver in a Multithreaded or a Servlet Environment*](thread.html)
	if you are thinking of using threads, as it covers some important points.

* When you are done using the `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` you should close
	it.

* In JDBC, the question mark (`?`) is the placeholder for the positional parameters of a `PreparedStatement`.
    There are, however, a number of PostgreSQL operators that contain a question mark.
    To keep such question marks in a SQL statement from being interpreted as positional parameters,
    use two question marks ( `??` ) as escape sequence.
    You can also use this escape sequence in a `Statement` , but that is not required.
    Specifically only in a `Statement` a single ( `?` ) can be used as an operator.

##  Using the ResultSet Interface

The following must be considered when using the `ResultSet` interface:

* Before reading any values, you must call `next()`. This returns true if there
	is a result, but more importantly, it prepares the row for processing.

* You must close a `ResultSet` by calling `close()` once you have finished using
	it.

* Once you make another query with the `Statement` used to create a `ResultSet`,
	the currently open `ResultSet` instance is closed automatically.

* When PreparedStatement API is used,  `ResultSet` switches to binary mode after
	five query executions (this default is set by the `prepareThreshold`

	connection property, see [Server Prepared Statements](server-prepare.md)).
	This may cause unexpected behavior when some methods are called. For example,
	results on method calls such as `getString()` on non-string data types,
	while logically equivalent, may be formatted differently after execution exceeds
	the set `prepareThreshold` when conversion to object method switches to one
	matching the return mode.

##  Performing Updates

To change data (perform an `INSERT` , `UPDATE` , or `DELETE` ) you use the
`executeUpdate()` method. This method is similar to the method `executeQuery()`

used to issue a `SELECT` statement, but it doesn't return a `ResultSet` ; instead
it returns the number of rows affected by the `INSERT` , `UPDATE` , or `DELETE`

statement. [Example 5.3, “Deleting Rows in JDBC”](update.html#delete-example)
illustrates the usage.

**Example 5.3. Deleting Rows in JDBC**

This example will issue a simple `DELETE` statement and print out the number of
rows deleted.

```java
int foovalue = 500;
PreparedStatement st = conn.prepareStatement("DELETE FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = ?");
st.setInt(1, foovalue);
int rowsDeleted = st.executeUpdate();
System.out.println(rowsDeleted + " rows deleted");
st.close();
```

##  Creating and Modifying Database Objects

To create, modify or drop a database object like a table or view you use the
`execute()` method.  This method is similar to the method `executeQuery()` , but
it doesn't return a result. [Example 5.4, “Dropping a Table in JDBC](/documentation/chapter5/ddl#drop-table-example)
illustrates the usage.

**Example 5.4. Dropping a Table in JDBC**

This example will drop a table.

```java
Statement st = conn.createStatement();
st.execute("DROP TABLE mytable");
st.close();
```

##  Using Java 8 Date and Time classes

The PostgreSQL™ JDBC driver implements native support for the
[Java 8 Date and Time API](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html)
(JSR-310) using JDBC 4.2.

**Table 5.1. Supported Java 8 Date and Time classes**
|PostgreSQL™|Java SE 8|
|---|---|
|DATE|LocalDate|
|TIME [ WITHOUT TIME ZONE ]|LocalTime|
|TIMESTAMP [ WITHOUT TIME ZONE ]|LocalDateTime|
|TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE|OffsetDateTime|

This is closely aligned with tables B-4 and B-5 of the JDBC 4.2 specification.
Note that `ZonedDateTime` , `Instant` and
`OffsetTime / TIME WITH TIME ZONE` are not supported. Also note
that all `OffsetDateTime` instances will have be in UTC (have offset 0).
This is because the backend stores them as UTC.

**Example 5.2. Reading Java 8 Date and Time values using JDBC**

```java
Statement st = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = 500");
while (rs.next())
{
    System.out.print("Column 1 returned ");
    LocalDate localDate = rs.getObject(1, LocalDate.class);
    System.out.println(localDate);
}
rs.close();
st.close();
```

For other data types simply pass other classes to `#getObject` .
Note that the Java data types needs to match the SQL data types in table 7.1.

**Example 5.3. Writing Java 8 Date and Time values using JDBC**

```java
LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.now();
PreparedStatement st = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO mytable (columnfoo) VALUES (?)");
st.setObject(1, localDate);
st.executeUpdate();
st.close();
```
