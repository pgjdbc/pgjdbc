**Notable changes**


### Fixed
* fix: fix `testGetSQLTypeQueryCache` by searching for xid type. We used to search for box type but it is now cached. xid is not cached, this nuance is required for the test.\
* fix `OidValueCorrectnessTest` BOX_ARRAY OID, by adding BOX_ARRAY to the `oidTypeName` map [PR #2810]((https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2810)
* fixes [Issue #2804](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2804).\
* fix: Make sure that github CI runs tests on all [PRs #2809]((https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2809)).
