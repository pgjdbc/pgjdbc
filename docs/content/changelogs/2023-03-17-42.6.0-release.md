**Notable changes**


### Fixed
* fix: use `PhantomReferences` instead of `Object.finalize()` to track Connection leaks [PR #2847](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2847)\
    The change replaces all uses of Object.finalize() with PhantomReferences.
    The leaked resources (Connections) are tracked in a helper thread that is active as long as
    there are connections in use. By default, the thread keeps running for 30 seconds after all
    the connections are released. The timeout is set with pgjdbc.config.cleanup.thread.ttl system property.

* refactor:(loom) replace the usages of synchronized with ReentrantLock [PR #2635](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2635)
    Fixes [Issue #1951](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/1951)
