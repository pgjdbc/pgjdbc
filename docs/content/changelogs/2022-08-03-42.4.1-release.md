title:  PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.4.1 Released
date:   2022-08-03 08:09:07 -0400
version: 42.4.1
---

#### Security

* fix: CVE-2022-31197 Fixes SQL generated in PgResultSet.refresh() to escape column identifiers so as to prevent SQL injection.
  * Previously, the column names for both key and data columns in the table were copied as-is into the generated
  SQL. This allowed a malicious table with column names that include statement terminator to be parsed and
  executed as multiple separate commands.
  * Also adds a new test class ResultSetRefreshTest to verify this change.
  * Reported by [Sho Kato](https://github.com/kato-sho)

#### Changed

* chore: skip publishing pgjdbc-osgi-test to Central
* chore: bump Gradle to 7.5
* test: update JUnit to 5.8.2

#### Added

* chore: added Gradle Wrapper Validation for verifying gradle-wrapper.jar
* chore: added "permissions: contents: read" for GitHub Actions to avoid unintentional modifications by the CI
* chore: support building pgjdbc with Java 17
