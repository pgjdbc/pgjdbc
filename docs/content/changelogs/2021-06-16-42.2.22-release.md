title:  PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.2.22 Released
date:   2021-06-16 10:09:32 -0400
version: 42.2.22
---

#### Fixed

- Regression caused by <https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/4fa2d5bc1ed8c0086a3a197fc1c28f7173d53cac>. Unfortunately
  due to the blocking nature of the driver and issues with seeing if there is a byte available on a blocking stream when it is encrypted
  this introduces unacceptable delays in returning from peek(). At this time there is no simple solution to this.
