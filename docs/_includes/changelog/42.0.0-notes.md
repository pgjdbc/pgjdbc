* Support for PostgreSQL versions below 8.2 was dropped
* java.util.logging is now used for logging: [logging documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/logging.html)
* Ensure executeBatch() can be used with pgbouncer. Previously pgjdbc could use server-prepared statements for batch execution even with prepareThreshold=0 (see [issue 742](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/742))
* Replication protocol API was added: [replication API documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/replication.html), [GitHub PR 550](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/550)
* Version bumped to 42.0.0 to avoid version clash with PostgreSQL version
* Error position is displayed when SQL has unterminated literals, comments, etc (see [issue 688](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/688))
