						<p>
							The website is produced with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.
							It allows you to build a reasonably good looking website that is
							easy to maintain and modular in nature. Templates are used from the _layout
							and _includes directories which are then used in conjunction with content that
							is created with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> or
							just standard HTML for input. Using Markdown allows the content
							to be generated with simple rules that allow a more free flowing process of
							writing without worrying about coding for the HTML.
						</p>
						<p>
							To get started please read the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll website</a>
							for installation instructions for that tool. After installing Jekyll you need to get
							the website project.  This is available from the same <a href="../development/git.html">git repository</a>
							that the main source code is in the docs subdirectory. To build the website simply
							run <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">jekyll build</span>.
							This should produce the website in the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">_site</span>
							subdirectory.

					<h2 class="underlined_10">Adding a Page</h2>
					<div>
						<p>
							To add a page the easiest thing to do is copy an existing one from the site like
							<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">about/about.html</span>
							and then rip out its contents.  Once new content is created and you have saved
							the new page you will need to add the new file to the menu system
							of the appropriate <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">_includes</span>
							subdirectory submenu.<br><br>

							A good place to look for example content is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites">Jekyll's wiki</a>
							site where there is a listing of real sites that use Jekyll. Many of these sites will
							have their repositories available for review.
