    <p>The PostgreSQL JDBC Driver is distributed under the BSD-2-Clause License. The simplest explanation of the
        licensing
        terms is that you can do whatever you want with the product and source code as long as you don't claim you wrote
        it
        or sue us. You should give it a read though, it's only half a page.</p>
