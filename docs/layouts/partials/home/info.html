            Why pgJDBC?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The PostgreSQL JDBC Driver allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database
            independent Java code. pgJDBC is an open source JDBC driver written in Pure Java (Type 4), and communicates in the
            PostgreSQL native network protocol. Because of this, the driver is platform independent; once compiled, the
            driver can be used on any system.
