JDBC is a core API of Java 1.1 and later. It provides a standard set of interfaces
to SQL-compliant databases.
		
PostgreSQL™ provides a *type 4* JDBC driver. Type 4 indicates that the driver is
written in Pure Java, and communicates in the database system's own network protocol.
Because of this, the driver is platform independent; once compiled, the driver
can be used on any system.
  		
This manual is not intended as a complete guide to JDBC programming, but should
help to get you started. For more information refer to the standard JDBC API
documentation. Also, take a look at the examples included with the source.
