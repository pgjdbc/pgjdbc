title:  PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.4.1 Released
date:   2022-08-03 08:09:07 -0400
categories:
    - new_release
version: 42.4.1

**Notable changes**

### Security
- fix: CVE-2022-31197 Fixes SQL generated in PgResultSet.refresh() to escape column identifiers so as to prevent SQL injection.
  - Previously, the column names for both key and data columns in the table were copied as-is into the generated
  SQL. This allowed a malicious table with column names that include statement terminator to be parsed and
  executed as multiple separate commands.
  - Also adds a new test class ResultSetRefreshTest to verify this change.
  - Reported by [Sho Kato](https://github.com/kato-sho)
  
### Changed
- chore: skip publishing pgjdbc-osgi-test to Central
- chore: bump Gradle to 7.5
- test: update JUnit to 5.8.2

### Added
- chore: added Gradle Wrapper Validation for verifying gradle-wrapper.jar
- chore: added "permissions: contents: read" for GitHub Actions to avoid unintentional modifications by the CI
- chore: support building pgjdbc with Java 17

### Fixed
