### Added

### Fixed
- fix: Partitioned indexes were not found fixes (#2078) (#2087)

- isValid() timeout should not be blocked [#1943](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1943) Cherry-picked [#2076](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2076)
  The usage of `setQueryTimeout();` with the same value as the `setNetworkTimeout();` is blocking the current transaction timeout.
  The timeouts are blocking each other with this approach.
- DatabaseMetaData.getTables returns columns in UPPER case as per the spec [PR #2092](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2092) fixes [Issue #830](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/830)
