### Changed

### Added

### Fixed
- Regression caused by https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/4fa2d5bc1ed8c0086a3a197fc1c28f7173d53cac. Unfortunately
  due to the blocking nature of the driver and issues with seeing if there is a byte available on a blocking stream when it is encrypted
  this introduces unacceptable delays in returning from peek(). At this time there is no simple solution to this.
