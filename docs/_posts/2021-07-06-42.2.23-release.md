date:   2021-07-06 09:17:31 -0400
categories:
    - new_release
version: 42.2.23
---
**Notable changes**

### Changed
- renewed the SSL keys for testing 
### Added

### Fixed
- getColumnPrecision for Numeric when scale and precision not specified now returns 0 instead of 131089 fixes: Issue #2188
- Calling refreshRow on an updateable resultset made the row readOnly. Fixes Issue #2193
- results should be updateable if there is a unique index available PR#2199 Fixes Issue #2196
- Rework sql type gathering to use OID instead of typname. 
  This does not have the issue of name shadowing / qual-names, and has the added benefit of fixing #1948.

[42.2.22] (2021-06-16 10:09:33 -0400)
### Changed

### Added

### Fixed
- Regression caused by https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/4fa2d5bc1ed8c0086a3a197fc1c28f7173d53cac. Unfortunately
  due to the blocking nature of the driver and issues with seeing if there is a byte available on a blocking stream when it is encrypted
  this introduces unacceptable delays in returning from peek(). At this time there is no simple solution to this.
  
[42.2.21] (2021-06-10 10:08:21 -0400)
### Changed
- update docs to reflect deprecated DataSource API setServerName backpatch [PR#2057](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2057) [PR #2105](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2105)

### Added

### Fixed
- make sure the table has defined primary keys when using updateable resultset backpatch [PR#2101](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2101) fixes [Issue 1975](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/1975) [PR #2106](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2106)
- backpatch [PR #2143](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2143) read notifies or errors that come in asynchronously after the ready for query [PR #2168](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2168)
- backpatch [PR #507](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/507) which reworks OSGI bundle activator fixes [ISSUE #2133](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2133)
- Fix database metadata getFunctions() and getProcedures() to ignore search_path when no schema pattern is specified. backpatch [PR #2174](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2174)
  fixes [Issue 2173](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2173)

[42.2.20] (2021-04-19 15:38:44 -0400)

### Changed

### Added

### Fixed
- Partitioned indexes were not found fixes [#2078](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2078) PR [#2087](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2087)

- isValid() timeout should not be blocked [#1943](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1943) Cherry-picked [#2076](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2076)
  The usage of `setQueryTimeout();` with the same value as the `setNetworkTimeout();` is blocking the current transaction timeout.
  The timeouts are blocking each other with this approach.
- DatabaseMetaData.getTables returns columns in UPPER case as per the spec [PR #2092](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2092) fixes [Issue #830](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/830)

## [42.2.19] (2021-02-18)

**Notable Changes**
- Now the driver uses SASLprep normalization for SCRAM authentication fixing some issues with spaces in passwords.
- If closeOnCompletion is called on an existing statement and the statement
is executed a second time it will fail.

### Changed
- Perf: avoid duplicate PGStream#changeSocket calls
- Fix: Actually close unclosed results. Previously was not closing the first unclosed result fixes #1903 (#1905)
There is a small behaviour change here as a result. If closeOnCompletion is called on an existing statement and the statement
is executed a second time it will fail.

### Added 
- Verify code via forbidden-apis (jdk-internal and jdk-non-portable signatures) [PR #2012](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2012)

### Fixed
- Fix Binary transfer for numeric fixes #1935
- Fix Allow specifying binaryTransferEnable even for those types that are not enabled by default
- Fix: properly set cancel socket timeout (#2044)
- Fix "Required class information missing" when old org.jboss:jandex parses pgjdbc classes [issue 2008][https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2008]
- Fix PGCopyInputStream returning the last row twice when reading with CopyOut API [issue 2016][https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2016]
- Fix Connnection.isValid() to not wait longer than existing network timeout [PR #2040](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2040)
- Fix Passwords with spaces (ASCII and non-ASCII) now work with SCRAM authentication (driver now uses SASLprep normalization) [PR #2052](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2052)
- Fix DatabaseMetaData.getTablePrivileges() to include views, materialized views, and foreign tables [PR #2049](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2049)
- Fix Resolve ParseError in PGtokenizer fixes #2050
- Fix return metadata privileges for views and foreign tables

## [42.2.18]
### Fixed
- Unfortunately changing the default of gssEncMode to ALLOW was not enough. The GSSEncMode Enum was not changed as well
fixed in #1920

## [42.2.17]
### Changed
- Change default of gssEncMode to ALLOW. PostgreSQL can deal with PREFER but there are cloud providers that did not implement the protocol properly. Libpq gets around this by checking for a GSS credential cache before attempting the connection. This is possible in JDK 8 and up, but not JDK6, or JDK7 fixes Issue #1868 [PR #1913](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1913)

### Added
- Add smallserial metadata [PR #899(https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/899)

### Fixed
- Avoid NullPointerException when receiving PGbox, PGcircle, PGline, PGlseg, PGpath, PGpoint, PGpolygon, and PGmoney [PR 1873] (https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1873).
- The driver returns enum and jsonb arrays elements as String objects (like in 42.2.14 and earlier versions) [PR 1879](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1879). 
- PgTokenizer was ignoring last empty token [PR #1882](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1882)
- Remove osgi from karaf fixes Issue #1891 [PR #1902](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1902)

## [42.2.16] (2020-08-20)
### Known issues
- The driver returns enum and jsonb arrays elements are returned as PGobject instances (fixed in 42.2.17)

### Fixed
- Arrays sent in binary format are now sent as 1 based. This was a regression for multi-dimensional arrays as well as text/varchar, oid and bytea arrays. 
  Since 42.2.0 single dimensional arrays were stored 0 based. They are now sent 1 based which is the SQL standard, and the default 
  for Postgres when sent as strings such as '{1,2,3}'. Fixes [issue 1860](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/1860) in [PR 1863](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1863).

## [42.2.15] (2020-08-14)
### Known issues
- The driver returns enum and jsonb arrays elements are returned as PGobject instances (fixed in 42.2.17)

### Changed
- Rename source distribution archive to `postgresql-$version-jdbc-src.tar.gz`, and add top-level archive folder [ba017507](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/ba0175072ee9c751c1496d2fe170f4af7256f1a5)
- Add the ability to connect with a GSSAPI encrypted connection. As of PostgreSQL version 12 GSSAPI encrypted connections
are possible. Now the driver will attempt to connect to the server with a GSSAPI encrypted connection. If that fails then
attempt an SSL connection, finally falling back to a plain text connection. All of this is controlled using both the gssEncMode
and sslMode parameters which, in concert with pg_hba.conf, determine if a particular mode is allowed and or required. [PR 1821](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1821) [ad921b9e](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/ad921b9e3563b28b9a03b1e2dfaad0e34efc02f1)
- Source release archive shades dependencies (scram) by default. It affects only postgresql-version-src.tar.gz release artifact [f0301eb9](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/f0301eb901f880059b00b0fb0a3ee93ef7d749a8)
- Refactor decoding arrays [PR 1194](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1194)

### Added
- Verify nullness with CheckerFramework [6e524ae5](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/6e524ae51cee67b25426c09a7083465c820c0a0d)

### Fixed
- Avoid preparedStatement leak when using updateable ResultSet via insert/update/refreshRow [PR 1815](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1815) [9a0d2b18](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9a0d2b18a81c7ec5974d4caf2ff2d218312da25f)
- Change order of checks for oid vs primary keys. OID's have been deprecated. [PR 1613](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1613)
- Close certificate file stream. [PR 1837](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1837)
- Make sure socketTimeout is enforced [PR 1831](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1831)
- Assume PKCS-8 SSL key format by default [PR 1819](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1819)
- Preserve unquoted unicode whitespace in array literals [PR 1266](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1266)

## [42.2.14] (2020-06-10)
### Changed
- Reverted com.github.waffle:waffle-jna, org.osgi:org.osgi.core, org.osgi:org.osgi.enterprise dependencies to optional=true in Maven [PR 1797](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1797).

## [42.2.13] (2020-06-04)

**Notable Changes**

- Security: The primary reason to release this version and to continue the 42.2.x branch is for CVE-2020-13692.

## [42.1.2] (2017-07-12)
### Changed

- Use server-prepared statements for batch inserts when prepareThreshold>0. Note: this enables batch to use server-prepared from the first *executeBatch()* execution (previously it waited for *prepareThreshold* *executeBatch()* calls) [abc3d9d7](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/abc3d9d7f34a001322fbbe53f25d5e77a33a667f)

## [42.0.0] (2017-02-20)
### Added
- Replication protocol API was added: [replication API documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org//documentation/head/replication.html). [PR 550](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/550)

- Add support for PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream(int, Reader). [ee4c4265](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/ee4c4265aebc1c73a1d1fabac5ba259d1fbfd1e4)

### Changed
- Version bumped to 42.0.0 to avoid version clash with PostgreSQL version and follow a better sematic versioning. [46634923](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/466349236622c6b03bb9cd8d7f517c3ce0586751)
- Ensure executeBatch() can be used with pgbouncer. Previously pgjdbc could use server-prepared statements for batch execution even with prepareThreshold=0. [Issue 742](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/742)
- Error position is displayed when SQL has unterminated literals, comments, etc. [Issue 688](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/688)
- Strict handling of accepted values in getBoolean and setObject(BOOLEAN), now it follows PostgreSQL accepted values, only 1 and 0 for numeric types are accepted (previously !=0 was true). [PR 732](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/732)
- Return correct versions and name of the driver. [PR 668](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/668)

### Removed
- Support for PostgreSQL versions below 8.2 was dropped. [PR 661](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/661)

### Deprecated
- Deprecated PGPoolingDataSource, instead of this class you should use a fully featured connection pool like HikariCP, vibur-dbcp, commons-dbcp, c3p0, etc. [PR 739](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/739)

### Regressions
- Data truncated in setCharacterStream. Fixed in 42.1.0
- No suitable driver found for jdbc:postgresql when using a DataSource implementation. Fixed in 42.1.0
