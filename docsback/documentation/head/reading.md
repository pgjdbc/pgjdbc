If you have not yet read it, you are advised you read the JDBC API Documentation
(supplied with Oracle's JDK) and the JDBC Specification.  Both are available from

[http://jdbc.postgresql.org/index.html](http://jdbc.postgresql.org/index.html)
contains updated information not included in this manual including Javadoc class
documentation and a FAQ. Additionally it offers precompiled drivers.
