/**
 * DataSource which uses connection pooling.  <font color="red">Don't use this if
 * your server/middleware vendor provides a connection pooling implementation
 * which interfaces with the PostgreSQL ConnectionPoolDataSource implementation!</font>
 * This class is provided as a convenience, but the JDBC Driver is really not
 * supposed to handle the connection pooling algorithm.  Instead, the server or
 * middleware product is supposed to handle the mechanics of connection pooling,
 * and use the PostgreSQL implementation of ConnectionPoolDataSource to provide
 * the connections to pool.
 *
 * <p>If you're sure you want to use this, then you must set the properties
 * dataSourceName, databaseName, user, and password (if required for the user).
 * The settings for serverName, portNumber, initialConnections, and
 * maxConnections are optional.  Note that <i>only connections
 * for the default user will be pooled!</i>  Connections for other users will
 * be normal non-pooled connections, and will not count against the maximum pool
 * size limit.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you put this DataSource in JNDI, and access it from different JVMs (or
 * otherwise load this class from different ClassLoaders), you'll end up with one
 * pool per ClassLoader or VM. This is another area where a server-specific
 * implementation may provide advanced features, such as using a single pool
 * across all VMs in a cluster.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation supports JDK 1.3 and higher.</p>
